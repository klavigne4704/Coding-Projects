					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I was born and raised in Kansas. From a very young age I was always fascinated by how games and computers worked. I got my first coding book at 9 years old, and since then have been hooked. Throughout high school I took coding courses, which further cemented my love for coding.</p>

					<h2>Plans for the Future</h2>
					<p>I plan to get my BSCSI from FHSU, and eventually hope to become a video game developer, maybe even working on the same franchises I grew up loving.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Current Experience</h2>
					<p>While I have worked a little with a few other languages like Kotlin and Java, I have spent most of my time learning C++. I have been working in C++ for about 3 years, and continue to improve every day.</p>
