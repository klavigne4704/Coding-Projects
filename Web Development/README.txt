This was my final for my first web development class. All of this was coded by hand with what we learned in class. Our goal was to make a website
that involved multiple pages, so I chose one a portfolio for myself. One of the pages includes commission rates for creating coding projects for customers
which includes all example figures for abitrary seperations of tiers.

The web address for the website is kjlavigne.infprojects.fhsu.edu/final/final.html

Note: Dark mode is recommended for viewing due to the text on the Project showcase section applying strangely.
